R script for merging USGS sample/fossil data with the System for Earth Sample Registration (SESAR) schema.

This R script was created for the purpose of merging USGS sample/fossil data with the System for Earth Sample Registration (SESAR) schema. The schema will be uploaded to the SESAR database to generate a IGSN/International GeoSample Number. This number is a 9-digit alphanumeric code that is assigned to specimens and related sampling features such as drill holes or wells to ensure their unique identification and unambiguous referencing of data generated by the study of samples.
